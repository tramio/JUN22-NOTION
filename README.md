# Building a Notion clone
Hi, thanks for stopping by! This month I am building a Notion clone with React.js and Firebase.

Here can you find the **[live demo](http://tramio.github.io/JUN22-NOTION)**. At the moment it only contains a navbar, but I'll keep adding functionalities gradually!

## Diary

### June 3, 2022
Focus: navbar  
Work: ensure that tabs that have no subtabs are properly rendered *(previously, an error was thrown when no subtabs were found when trying to render a tab)*, render subtabs that have a "segment" property in a corresponding div  
Practiced: difference between getBy, queryBy and findBy (Testing Library), conditional rendering (React)

### June 2, 2022
Focus: navbar  
Work: initialized the project, drafted navbar links  
Practiced: React basics, TDD with Jest, React Testing Library
